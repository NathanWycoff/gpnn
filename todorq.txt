- Understand the nullspace of a neural network

- To get the image of the unit box given an arbitrary net (useful for viz).

- (opt) Hilbert Curve init in Z space?
    Will skip it for now, as seems nontrivial.
    The complication arises from the fact that the latent design will not generally be on [0,1]^P.
    A possible solution:
    1) Initialize at X space HC.
    2) Feed design through net.
    3) Solve least squares problem on original HC vs result of neural net.
    4) That transform is our new HC target.

- Bobby's bounding box idea

Done:
1) Get Hilbert Curve init in X space working fully
2) Put shit into functions and make tests
